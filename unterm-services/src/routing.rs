//! Making the front door the only door.
//!
//! Everything M5 built — leases, evidence, revocation, the audit trail — is
//! worth exactly as much as the difficulty of going around it. A model that
//! can run `curl http://127.0.0.1:9222/json` or `npx playwright` has a
//! browser with no lease, no record and nothing to revoke, and every panel
//! Unterm shows about what it did is then a polite fiction.
//!
//! So a managed brain's shell is checked for the ways round: raw CDP, the
//! automation libraries, the drivers, and launching a browser with a
//! debugging port of its own. Refused with the thing to do instead, because
//! a refusal that does not say "use provider.call" is one the model will work
//! around rather than comply with.
//!
//! **This is not a sandbox.** A determined model can obfuscate a command
//! beyond what pattern-matching sees, and nothing here stops it — the same
//! honest limit as the approval boundary. What it does do is make the
//! supported path the easy one and the way round a deliberate act that
//! leaves a refusal in the trail. Enforcement that cannot be evaded needs the
//! operating system, and that is a different piece of work than this.
