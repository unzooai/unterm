//! The processes Unterm is made of, and what state each one is in.
//!
//! Since M1 there are three roles that can exist independently: the **Core**
//! that owns the sessions, the **GUI** that draws them, and the **MCP
//! server** the Core hosts for agents. The property that matters is that they
//! are genuinely independent — a Core with no GUI is a working Unterm, an
//! agent driving sessions with nobody logged in is the normal case, and a GUI
//! that dies must not take the work with it.
//!
//! This module is what can *say* that: discovery from the records each
//! process writes, a readiness that distinguishes alive from usable, and the
//! transitions a machine going to sleep or a process being killed put them
//! through.
//!
//! **Liveness is not readiness**, and conflating them is the bug this exists
//! to prevent. A Core that is running but still replaying scrollback is alive
//! and not ready; a client told "ready" then gets errors it cannot explain.
//! A process that is *ready* answers work now.
