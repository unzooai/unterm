//! Noticing that the machine slept, without asking the operating system.
//!
//! macOS announces sleep on `NSWorkspace`'s own notification centre, Windows
//! sends `WM_POWERBROADCAST`, and Linux has logind — three APIs, three sets
//! of glue, and none of them testable without putting a real machine to
//! sleep. There is a simpler signal that works everywhere and can be tested
//! by feeding it numbers: **the two clocks disagree**.
//!
//! A monotonic clock does not advance while the machine is suspended — that
//! is true of `mach_absolute_time`, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` and
//! `QueryPerformanceCounter` alike. The wall clock does. So when wall time
//! has moved far more than monotonic time between two ticks, the gap is how
//! long the machine was away.
//!
//! What this catches is **wake**, which is the event that actually needs
//! acting on: a provider's port, a network mount and any lease's expiry have
//! all had time to change. Logout and shutdown are not detectable this way
//! and still want their platform hooks — that is a real limit, not an
//! oversight, and [`crate::supervisor::action_for`] already says what those
//! two should do when somebody wires them.
