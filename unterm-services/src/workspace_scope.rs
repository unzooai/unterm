//! Workspaces: named roots that work is confined to, and blind to each other.
//!
//! A note on the word, because this codebase already uses it: `workspace.*`
//! on the MCP surface means a saved pane layout, and has since long before
//! this. These are a different thing with the same name in the plan, so they
//! live under `scope.*` on the wire. Nothing here touches pane layouts.
//!
//! The property that matters — **two workspaces cannot see each other** —
//! cannot be established by checking one path against one root. It is a
//! property of the whole set, so a scope is built by reading every workspace
//! and turning the others into explicit denials. That is why this module
//! exists at all rather than callers assembling a [`PathScope`] themselves:
//! a caller who forgets the other roots gets a scope that looks right and
//! leaks.
//!
//! Nesting is refused at creation. A workspace inside another cannot be
//! isolated from it — the outer one's allow and the inner one's deny describe
//! the same files — and the honest moment to say so is when it is being
//! created, not on the first path that surprises somebody.
