//! The operating system asking a process to stop.
//!
//! Sleep and wake are noticed by watching two clocks
//! ([`crate::wake_watch`]) — no platform API needed. Logout and shutdown
//! cannot be inferred that way, and they are the two that matter most,
//! because they are when work is about to be taken away.
//!
//! Every platform *does* ask, and the asking is remarkably similar once you
//! find it:
//!
//! * **macOS and Linux** send `SIGTERM` to a process on logout and on
//!   shutdown. That is not an approximation of the hook — it *is* the hook.
//! * **Windows** has no signals, but a console process gets
//!   `CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT` and `CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT` through
//!   `SetConsoleCtrlHandler`. `unterm-core` is a console binary, which is why
//!   this is installed there rather than in the window.
//!
//! The Core is the right place for all of it: it owns the sessions and the
//! task store, so it is the process whose sudden death costs something. A
//! window closing costs a window.
//!
//! What "stop now" means is deliberately small. A shutdown gives seconds, not
//! minutes — the system will kill whatever is still running — so this writes
//! down *that* it is stopping and why, and gets out of the way. Trying to
//! finish work here is how a process gets killed halfway through finishing
//! it, which is worse than not having started.
