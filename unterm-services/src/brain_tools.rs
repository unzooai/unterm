//! Where a model's tool request meets the gateway.
//!
//! A brain adapter produces a *request*: the model would like a shell run, a
//! file written, a pane killed. Nothing in `unterm-brain` can perform one —
//! there is no gateway there, and no code that would call it. This is the
//! only bridge, and it goes through the same door as everything else.
//!
//! The translation is the interesting part. A model says `Bash` or `shell` or
//! `run_command`; the gateway judges `exec.run`. Naming a tool the gateway
//! does not know must not become permission, so an unrecognised tool is
//! judged as a mutation and asked about, never waved through. That asymmetry
//! is deliberate: the cost of asking about something harmless is a prompt,
//! and the cost of the other mistake is whatever the tool did.
