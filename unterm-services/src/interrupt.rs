//! Interrupting what is running in a pane.
//!
//! On a Unix pty, writing `0x03` is the whole story: the line discipline turns
//! it into SIGINT for the foreground process group. On Windows there is no
//! line discipline. ConPTY hands the byte to the console as a key record, the
//! shell's line editor sees it and abandons the line it was editing -- and a
//! program that is running and *not reading input*, which is every program you
//! actually want to interrupt, never hears about it.
//!
//! So Windows needs the real thing: a console control event, raised for the
//! process group that owns the pane. Doing that from outside the console means
//! attaching to it, and a process can be attached to exactly one console --
//! so reaching another one means giving up its own. That is a process-wide
//! change, and two of its consequences are handled here rather than
//! discovered later:
//!
//! - The event reaches every process on the console, including us by then, so
//!   a handler that reports "handled" is installed first -- once, and never
//!   removed, because taking it off is a race whose loser exits with
//!   STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT.
//! - A process that has a console of its own is not asked to give it up. The
//!   window and the MCP server have none, which is what makes this safe there;
//!   in a console program the same call would take that program's own output
//!   away mid-run. `stop_foreground` still stops the command either way.
