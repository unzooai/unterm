//! Text shaping for next-core, straight onto HarfBuzz.
//!
//! `font_discovery` picks a file and `font_raster` draws a glyph, but neither
//! knows which glyphs a string becomes. That is shaping: text in, positioned
//! glyph ids out. It is not a per-character mapping — ligatures fuse several
//! characters into one glyph, combining marks attach to the base without
//! advancing, and scripts like Arabic pick a different glyph per position.
//!
//! HarfBuzz is the library every terminal uses for this, including the one we
//! are replacing. Using it directly is the plan: own the architecture, reuse
//! the mature library.
