//! Turning a row of cells into glyphs, ligatures included.
//!
//! A terminal is a grid, and shaping is not: `!=` becomes one glyph in a font
//! that has the ligature, Arabic picks a different glyph per position, and a
//! combining mark rides on its base without advancing at all. So the two have
//! to be reconciled, and every terminal reconciles them the same way -- shape
//! the text, then place each glyph at the *cell its cluster came from* rather
//! than at the pen position shaping would have used.
//!
//! Placing by cluster is what keeps the grid honest. A ligature spans the
//! cells its characters occupied and the cursor still lands between them; a
//! font whose advances drift from the cell width cannot pull the row out of
//! alignment, because the row's positions never came from the advances.
