//! Launch a crew of agents on one task.
//!
//! Type the task, pick a crew, press Enter. Each agent gets its own git
//! worktree and its own tab, so they cannot tread on each other, and what they
//! produce is reviewed side by side afterwards.
//!
//! One card and no sub-menus, which is the shape the previous front end
//! settled on: the line you type into is the task, and the rows are crews.
//! Asking for the task and the crew in two steps means the crew is chosen
//! before the task is written, and the task is what tells you how many agents
//! it is worth.
//!
//! The crews come from the agents actually on PATH. Offering `claude + codex`
//! on a machine with no codex is offering a launch that fails afterwards, when
//! the worktrees already exist.
