//!
//! Ported from the previous front end's `chrome_colors.rs`, coefficients and
//! all, so the top bar, sidebar and status bar look the way they did rather
//! than the way whoever rebuilt them guessed. The point of it is that the
//! chrome should *frame* the terminal rather than become a large grey slab
//! around it, which is why the amounts are so small.
//!
//! Mixing happens in linear light, as it did before. Blending sRGB values
//! directly is the usual way a carefully chosen frame turns muddy: the same
//! numeric amount lands in a different place, and every tone here was picked
//! against the linear result.
//!
//! The contrast tests came across too. They are the reason the values can be
//! adjusted at all: every bundled theme has to keep its chrome text above
//! WCAG AA and its focus rail visible, and the tests say so rather than
//! leaving it to the eye.
