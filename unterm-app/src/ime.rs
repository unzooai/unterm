//! collects the keystrokes, shows what it has so far, and hands over the

//! Chinese Windows cannot type Chinese at all -- the keystrokes arrive as
//! Latin letters and the candidate list never appears.
//!
//! Two things have to be right. The half-composed text has to be drawn where
//! the cursor is, because it is not in the shell yet and the shell cannot draw
//! it. And the system has to be told where that is, or it puts its candidate
//! list in the corner of the screen, away from what the user is typing.
