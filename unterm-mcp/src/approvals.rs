//! `approval.*` — the questions waiting for a human, and answering them.
//!
//! The gateway has been able to ask since M3, and until now nothing could
//! answer: a destructive action from an identified agent created a question
//! that sat there until it expired. That is a refusal with a five-minute
//! delay, dressed as a prompt.
//!
//! **Who may answer.** Not the agent. `approval.decide` refuses any caller
//! that reached the surface over the network, and is reachable only from
//! in-process callers — the settings page, and the application itself. The
//! boundary is not a security perimeter and should not be described as one:
//! an agent with a shell can read the instance token, run the CLI, and drive
//! this machine as thoroughly as the person sitting at it. What it is, is a
//! *deliberation* boundary. An agent asking for permission must stop and a
//! human must notice, and an agent that could answer its own question would
//! never stop.
