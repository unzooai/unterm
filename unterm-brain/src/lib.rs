//! One shape for what a model did, whatever CLI printed it.
//!
//! Unterm already watches agents from the outside — screen tails, window
//! titles, terminal bells, progress escapes. That works for any program and
//! knows almost nothing: it can tell that something is happening, not what
//! was asked, what tool was called, or how many tokens it cost. Codex and
//! Claude both emit structured streams saying exactly that, in two different
//! vocabularies.
//!
//! This is the third vocabulary, the one everything downstream reads. The
//! milestone's gate is that the two adapters produce *isomorphic* events, so
//! the Cockpit, the audit trail and the task store never learn which CLI was
//! behind a turn.
//!
//! **Adapters are pure.** A line of bytes goes in, events come out; nothing
//! here spawns a process, opens a socket or performs a tool call. That is
//! deliberate and it is what makes the gate testable: two adapters can be fed
//! recordings and compared, with no processes involved. The runtime above
//! does the side effects — in particular, a [`BrainEvent::ToolRequested`] is
//! a *request*, and the only thing allowed to act on it is the action
//! gateway.
